          <h2>A Vim User In A VSCode World</h2>
          <hr />
	  <p>
	    I was originally going to talk about why I switched to Linux and give my experiences and opinions. But something
	    more intresting happened to me recently. So intresting, I stopped doing recreational programming because I got
	    an internship at Ferrari. I know, this is what the industry does to a mother fucker. It's all good tho, I still
	    love programming. I just need to find something new to work on or maybe I start working on my poker game again?
	    Besides that, this internship has been an amazing opprotunity, everything about it is great! The only downside is
	    I'm working on Windows computer. It just feels slower is all, but it's not the end of the world! I can still install
	    Neovim.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    Not a single thing could have prepared me for what was going to happen when I asked my manager at Ferrari
	    to install vim. I am the only person at the office to work in vim. Everyone else either uses VS Code or some
	    derivative of it and I was not going to be that guy who's gonna be different. I lasted 3 days before I downloaded
	    the binaries for Neovim, WezTerm, and Fastfetch. I also learned the basics of powershell so I can pretend I'm
	    usig some sort of Unix machine (It did not feel like a Unix machine). One of my coworkers, lets call him Jay, took
	    notice to this. Jay is probably the funniest person in the office, he did not spare me when he discovered this.
	    Took maybe a day for everyone to start calling me V-Ron, Vim Ron, or "The Vimmer". The last one is not cool, it
	    does not sound cool, it's hilarious. Genuinely the best and funniest nickname I have ever gotten.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    It's come to a point where whenever Jay sees someone slacking or struggling with something basic, he says,
	    "Broooo, you gotta be like V-Ron, you gotta start vimming. I don't see you vimming." Everyone on my team now
	    calls me V-Ron and it's probably the best thing to happen at the office. I'm not some clueless loser, I know
	    I'm weird for using vim (even weirder to know I am writing this in Emacs). I think that's the biggest issue
	    with people who obsess over their text editor or operating system. I love working in vim, I love vim motions,
	    I love the simplicity of it all. But I can recognize the text editor doesn't make a better developer. While I am
	    slightly more technical in some aspects when it comes to linux, working the terminal, and debugging at some points,
	    I am not better than them. They are clearly on a level higher than me because I do not have the experience they do.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	    I'm not embarresed for being the only person in my office to use Vim. I think I'm influencing my coworkers, my manager
	    started using Nano (fucking dis-GUST-ing) and my coworker and I teased him for it. They are also making bash scripts now
	    and creating alias' for commands. Jokes aside, I'm happy to be apart of the team and that I'm able to teach people
	    with years of experience something new. I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing because it seems like I'm doing a good job.
	    I straight up asked my manager if I was and he said yes, so I'm doing a good job. I don't really know how to end this,
	    I'm not so good at writing. Oh well, I'll just end it with this: It does not matter if you use vim, emacs, VS Code, or
	    whatever other text editor, AI bros are insufferable and should be sent to a shrink.
